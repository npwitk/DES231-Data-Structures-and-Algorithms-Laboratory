# DES231: Data Structures and Algorithms Laboratory

This repository contains Java files for **DES231: Data Structures and Algorithms Laboratory**, a course at SIIT, Thammasat University. The course provides a comprehensive introduction to data structures and algorithms, focusing on both theoretical understanding and practical implementation.

The repository is organized by lab sessions, progressing from foundational programming concepts to more advanced data structures. Each folder corresponds to a specific topic and contains code exercises based on the instructions given during the course. The files include detailed comments to explain the implementation and logic.

The course begins with fundamental Java programming concepts, such as loops, to help students become familiar with the language. It then moves on to linear data structures like arrays, recursion, sorting algorithms, hashing techniques, singly linked lists, stacks, and queues. 

For the final part of the course, the focus shifts to non-linear data structures, including trees, binary trees, binary search trees, heaps, and graphs. Topics like traversal algorithms, searching, insertion, and deletion are also covered in detail.
